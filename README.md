<h1>Guests and Hotels in Puerto Escondido</h1>

Hola! I created this Rails application to describe the one to many relationship between hotels and guests in the city where I live, Puerto Escondido. 

As the webiste has not gone live yet, you can access it by pulling down this repo to your hard drive and then running ```rails s``` which will run the application on your local machine. Proceed to ```http://localhost:3000/``` where you will be welcomed by a greeting screen. From there, you can proceed to view the hotels and the guests, and then to perform CRUD functionality on them.
